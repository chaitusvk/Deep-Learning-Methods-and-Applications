\chapter{Objective}



In the present study natural convection around heated horizontal cylinder kept in unbounded fluid is investigated for a wide range of Ra from 10 to $10^6$.Based on this study the Author aims to propose a correlation which can predict the local Nu around the cylinder surface.The effect of confinement on the heat transfer performance is studied next.The study is carried out for horizontal confinement as well as vertical confinement.The study is done for different L/D ratios and Ra.The study further aims to do a direct comparision of the effect of confinement on natural convection heat transfer around horizontal cylinder with the results obtained for unbounded cylinder.
